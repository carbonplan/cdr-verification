        "comments": "The mass of CO2 that escapes from the storage system must include a consideration of poth observed leakage and potential future leakage. For terrestrial geologic storage, fugitive emissions can be directly monitored during and after the injection period,, though this is more challenging for subseafloor reservoirs. If geologic storage results in functionally stable form on a short timescale \u2014 for example, via subsurface mineralization \u2014 fugitive emissions associated with the full lifetime of storage may be estimated based on direct observations of the storage reservoir. If, however, the integrity of geologic storage requires ongoing monitoring and maintenance, for example with the injection of supercritical CO2, the potential for future fugitive emissions must be modeled. For alternative storage systems, like mineralization in concrete, it is possible to directly measure the conversion of input CO2 into a functionally stable form and therefore the fugitive emissions from the storage system.",

If, however, the integrity of storage requires ongoing monitoring and maintenance \u2014 for example with the injection of supercritical CO2 \u2014 an evaluation of permanence claims must consider the monitoring and maintenance plan, as well as any applicable regulatory structure that assigns ongoing liability for storage integrity.
