It can also be checked for consistency against operational data from the CO2 capture system system.",execution ,negligible,project,,
,,,,2,net volume,store_leak,storage system leakage,"The mass of CO2 that escapes from the storage system must include a consideration of poth observed leakage and potential future leakage. For terrestrial geologic storage, fugitive emissions can be directly monitored during and after the injection period,, though this is more challenging for subseafloor reservoirs. If geologic storage results in functionally stable form on a short timescale — for example, via subsurface mineralization — fugitive emissions associated with the full lifetime of storage may be estimated based on direct observations of the storage reservoir. If, however, the integrity of geologic storage requires ongoing monitoring and maintenance, for example with the injection of supercritical CO2, the potential for future fugitive emissions must be modeled. For alternative storage systems, like mineralization in concrete, it is possible to directly measure the conversion of input CO2 into a functionally stable form and therefore the fugitive emissions from the storage system.

The embodied emissions of equipment and project infrastructure must also be considered. This would include manufacturing and transportation-related emissions for equipment and infrastructure, like a calciner or air contactor, that is not consumed as part of the project operation. Equipment emissions should be amortized over the expected carbon removal over the lifetime of the equipment.",execution ,low,project,,
,,,,5,permanence,stor_maint,storage system monitoring and maintenance,"If storage results in a functionally stable form of CO2 on a short timescale — for example, via subsurface mineralization or mineralization in concrete — demonstration that the stable form has been achieved is enough to establish permanence. If, however, the integrity of storage requires ongoing monitoring and maintenance — for example with the injection of supercritical CO2 — an evaluation of permanence claims must consider the monitoring and maintenance plan, as well as any applicable regulatory structure that assigns ongoing liability for storage integrity. One important consideration is whether or not there is a track record of sufficient administrative capacity to guarantee execution of monitoring, and maintenance, and liability arrangements.
