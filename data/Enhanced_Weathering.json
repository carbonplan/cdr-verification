      "comments": "Assuming full dissolution of the applied rock, it is possible to calculate the optimum atmospheric removal assuming full dissolution. Optimum drawdown depends on rock composition, particle size, kinetics, and applied volumes. It is possible to directly analyze rock composition, which is critical not only for carbon accounting, but also for tracking other ecosystem and agricultural impacts. Applied volume can be confirmed via an audit of operational records.",

      "comments": "The rate of rock weathering depends on factors including particle size, soil type, ambient temperature, precipitation, and irrigation. While most feedstock dissolution potential will ultimately be realized, the effective drawdown from EW occurs when the CO2 is actually removed from the atmosphere. The measurement of weathering rates \u2014 and by extension the fraction of the mineral feedstock that remains after a given period of time \u2014 is an area of active innovation. Existing approaches include measuring temporally granular changes to pH and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and tracking changes in the concentration of tracer elements which originate in the applied mineral and persist in the soil after rock weathering.",

Non-CO2 sources of acidity in the soil may react with the resulting alkalinity, reducing total CO2 drawdown. These sources of acid may include protons associated with mineral and organic surfaces, denitrification, or sulfide oxidation.",

Since secondary mineral formation results in less atmospheric carbon removal, it is important to characterize via soil mineralogy techniques like x-ray diffraction in order to accurately determine the total amount of carbon removed from that atmosphere.",

The longer-term fate of this DIC is hard to precisely estimate. Groundwater can spend days to centuries in the ground before being discharged to streams. Once in surface waters, outgassing (evasion) might occur, for example as a result of shifts in pH.  The long time-scale of this process makes it difficult to study directly, but regional models may inform evasion estimates.",

The embodied emissions of non-consumed project equipment and infrastructure must also be considered, amortized over the expected lifetime of operation. There are not yet consistent best practices around whether or how to account for the embodied emissions of equipment or infrastructure that is used but not owned by the project. Transparency around these boundary assumptions, as well as the data sources and associated uncertainties across the board, is necessary for LCA consistency and comparability.",

Any emissions impact associated with the displaced agricultural lime use could thus potentially counterbalance life cycle emissions of applying the weathering mineral. Lime emissions could be estimated based on data about prior usage on the parcel of land in question, or through general best practices for the region and crop type.",
