  "pathway_description": "Biomaterial injection is a type of biomass carbon removal and storage (BiCRS) that uses photosynthesis to remove CO\u2082 from the atmosphere, transforms the resulting biomass (e.g. via pyrolysis or creation of a slurry), and injects it into a geologic reservoir to achieve long-term storage. This pathway is VCL 3-5, meaning that current quantification capacity can establish permanent carbon removal, but that for certain approaches, very significant uncertainties remain.",

The feedstock quantity can be checked for consistency against operational records, and will form the basis for estimating feedstock-related upstream emissions (see Carbon storage counterfactual, Feedstock use counterfactual, and Market effects) as well as understanding the removal efficiency of the process. In addition to characterizing carbon content, a feedstock sampling protocol should characterize embodied nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. This enables an assessment of potential nutrient depletion and may inform the estimation of upstream emissions (see Feedstock use counterfactual). Any emissions associated with the process of biomass cultivation or procurement must be included in the project\u2019s lifecycle assessment (see Materials, Energy, and Non-CO\u2082 biomass emissions).",

      "description": "Some biomaterial injection approaches store carbon-containing materials like biosolids or paper sludge with minimal processing. Others rely on processes like pyrolysis to transform biomass into an injectable form like bio-oil, resulting in the direct emission of some portion of the carbon originally contained in the biomass feedstock. Quantifying emissions from biomass transformation supports the assessment of how efficiently a process converts biomass into long-term carbon storage or useful co-products. Biomass carbon lost during biomass transformation can be estimated by comparing the mass of carbon in the stored biomaterial to the mass of carbon contained in the biomass feedstock (see Biomass procurement) or via direct monitoring of the transformation process. For a transformation process like pyrolysis, the conversion efficiency and characteristics of output is contingent on the specific feedstock and operating conditions of the pyrolyzer, and a sampling regime should be designed accordingly. If the transformation process produces other carbon-containing products, such as syngas, tar, or char, we recommend the embodied carbon be conservatively classified as \u201cemitted\u201d unless the product has a clearly defined path to durable storage. Any emissions from the biomass transformation process beyond biogenic CO\u2082 must be included in the project\u2019s lifecycle assessment (see Materials, Energy, and Non-CO\u2082 biomass emissions).",

These risks are contingent upon the characteristics of the injected biomaterial (e.g. pH), the operation and maintenance of the well (e.g. pressure, temperature, and ultimate well capping), and the depth and geology of the storage reservoir. Monitoring for leakage will likely require a combination of direct measurements and modeling. This approach may be partially dictated by the relevant permitting authority (e.g. EPA UIC), but characterizing leakage risks is still an area of active research.

For example, if agricultural waste is currently used as animal feed or left on the fields to contribute to nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in soils, using that agricultural waste for CDR could result in new demand for feed or fertilizer, respectively. Current feedstock uses can be evaluated on a project-by-project basis, and the carbon impact of replacements can be estimated via lifecycle assessment. We recommend accounting for feedstock replacement emissions that involve existing feedstock uses rather than potential future uses. For example, agricultural feedstocks used for CDR should be evaluated based on their current uses (e.g. for animal feed or soil nutrients) rather than potential future uses that are not practiced today. The counterfactual for existing utilization should be flexible, and re-evaluated in the future if prevailing practices change. This component may not apply in cases where carbon is purpose grown.",
