Quantifying emissions from biomass transformation supports the assessment of how efficiently a process converts biomass into long-term carbon storage or useful co-products. Biomass transformation emissions can be estimated by comparing the mass of CO2 that is captured for durable storage to the mass of carbon contained in the biomass feedstock (See Biomass feedstock). If the transformation process produces other carbon-containing products, such as syngas, tar, or char, we recommend the embodied carbon be conservatively classified as \u201cemitted\u201d unless the product has a clearly defined path to durable storage.",

Monitoring for leakage will likely require a combination of direct measurements and modeling.

For example, if agricultural waste is currently used as animal feed or left on the fields to contribute to nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in soils, using that agricultural waste for CDR could result in new demand for feed or fertilizer, respectively. Current feedstock uses can be evaluated on a project-by-project basis, and the carbon impact of replacements can be estimated via lifecycle assessment. We recommend accounting for feedstock replacement emissions that involve existing feedstock uses rather than potential future uses. For example, agricultural feedstocks used for CDR should be evaluated based on their current uses (e.g. for animal feed or soil nutrients) rather than potential future uses that are not practiced today. The counterfactual for existing utilization should be flexible, and re-evaluated in the future if prevailing practices change.",
