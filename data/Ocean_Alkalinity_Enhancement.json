      "comments": "Assuming full dissolution of the applied rock, it is possible to calculate the optimum atmospheric removal assuming full dissolution. Optimum drawdown depends on rock composition, particle size, kinetics, and applied volumes. It is possible to directly analyze rock composition, which is critical not only for carbon accounting, but also for tracking other ecosystem and agricultural impacts. Applied volume can be confirmed via an audit of operational records.",

      "comments": "The rate of rock weathering depends on factors including particle size, soil type, ambient temperature, precipitation, and irrigation. While most feedstock dissolution potential will ultimately be realized, the effective drawdown from EW occurs when the CO2 is actually removed from the atmosphere. The measurement of weathering rates \u2014 and by extension the fraction of the mineral feedstock that remains after a given period of time \u2014 is an area of active innovation. Existing approaches include measuring temporally granular changes to pH and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and tracking changes in the concentration of tracer elements which originate in the applied mineral and persist in the soil after rock weathering.",

      "comments": "The additional flux of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from the site of application into regional groundwater systems represents captured CO2. The longer-term fate of this DIC is hard to precisely estimate. Groundwater can spend from days to centuries in the ground before being discharged to streams. Once in surface waters, outgassing might occur, for example as a result of shifts in pH. The long time-scale of this process makes it difficult to study directly, but regional models may inform estimates.",

The embodied emissions of equipment and project infrastructure must also be considered. This would include manufacturing and transportation-related emissions for equipment and infrastructure, like a calciner or air contactor, that is not consumed as part of the project operation. Equipment emissions should be amortized over the expected carbon removal over the lifetime of the equipment.",
