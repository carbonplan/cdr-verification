  "pathway_description": "Alkaline waste mineralization enhances the weathering process of alkaline waste streams (e.g. mine tailings or slag) to enhance the uptake and storage of atmospheric CO\u2082. Here, we specifically consider methods that primarily store atmospheric CO2 in the form of solid carbonates. This pathway is VCL 3-5, meaning that current quantification capacity can establish permanent carbon removal, but that for certain approaches, significant uncertainties remain.",

      "description": "It is possible to calculate potential atmospheric removal by assuming full weathering of the alkaline feedstock to provide an absolute maximum ceiling value for potential CDR, against which any estimates of realized CDR should be compared. The mass of CO\u2082 captured through alkaline feedstock weathering and carbonate mineralization can be quantified by measuring CO\u2082 loss from air (e.g. using eddy covariance flux towers or dynamic closed chambers), measurement of carbonate chemistry parameters (e.g. pH, TA, or DIC), or measuring changes in mineral content. If measuring changes in mineral content, it is critical to carefully characterize the starting carbonate content and variability of the feedstock. It is likely that a combination of quantification approaches will be needed to bound outcomes. Calibrated reactive transport models may also play a role in estimating long-term trends of CO\u2082 uptake. Measurement and modeling approaches must take into account the potential for short-term cycles of absorption and outgassing.",

The baseline rate of carbonate formation may be strongly dependent on the physical characteristics of the feedstock (e.g. surface area and grain size distribution), environment (e.g. mine design, climate, weather) and treatment of the alkaline waste material, in the present and future. In some systems, the baseline may be best characterized by ongoing measurements of an untreated control.",

      "description": "Carbonates may remain exposed to the atmosphere or be buried over time depending on the location and approach. A portion of exposed and buried carbonates may undergo weathering over time. If and when carbonates weather, there is an additional shift in CO\u2082 fluxes as a result of introducing alkalinity to the system and storing additional CO\u2082 as bicarbonate. This process approximately doubles the associated CO\u2082 storage. Although most carbonates will ultimately weather, this process should only be credited when the impact on atmospheric CO\u2082 actually occurs and must take into account the full suite of uncertainties related to quantifying weathering outcomes (see the Enhanced Weathering pathway). In the absence of clear measurement of carbonate weathering, we recommend alkaline waste mineralization approaches only consider and credit the mineral phase of CO\u2082 storage.",
