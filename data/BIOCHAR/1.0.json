  "pathway_description": "Biochar is a type of biomass carbon removal and storage (BiCRS) that uses photosynthesis to remove CO\u2082 from the atmosphere, and transforms biomass to achieve longer-term storage of biomass carbon. Here, we specifically consider biochar that is applied to agricultural fields. This pathway is VCL 1-3, meaning that current quantification capacity may be able to establish permanent carbon removal, but that for certain approaches, significant uncertainties remain, primarily driven by the uncertainty around biochar durability.",

Mass of carbon in produced biochar can be compared to the mass of carbon in the biomass feedstock to estimate the CO\u2082 emitted during the biomass transformation process. This quantity can also be checked for consistency against operational data and expected conversion efficiency of the pyrolyzer. In addition to characterizing carbon content, a sampling protocol for produced biochar should characterize the physical and chemical characteristics that inform the expected durability of biochar (e.g. elemental ratios, volatile and ash content, porosity; see Biochar degradation) and the impact of biochar application (e.g. water retention, surface area, surface charge, liming capacity, heavy metal content, or polyaromatic hydrocarbon and polychlorinated biphenyls; see Soil carbon impacts, Change in agricultural lime use, Change in fertilizer use, Change in agricultural yields). The conversion efficiency, structure, and chemistry of produced biochar are contingent on the specific feedstock and operating conditions of the pyrolyzer, and a sampling regime should be designed accordingly.",

For example, if agricultural waste is currently used as animal feed or left on the fields to contribute to nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium or to soil organic carbon, turning that agricultural waste into biochar could result in new demand for feed, fertilizer, or soil amendments, respectively. Current feedstock uses can be evaluated on a project-by-project basis, and the carbon impact of replacements can be estimated via lifecycle assessments. We recommend accounting for feedstock replacement emissions that involve existing feedstock uses rather than potential future uses. For example, agricultural feedstocks for biochar should be evaluated based on their current uses (e.g. for animal feed or soil nutrients) rather than potential future uses that are not practiced today (e.g. potential use for bioenergy). The counterfactual for existing utilization should be flexible, and re-evaluated in the future if prevailing practices change.",

      "description": "Any emissions associated with indirect land use change as a result of feedstock demand must be considered. For example, paying farmers for agricultural waste will likely increase the profitability of their operations, and could result in an increase in acres planted. Creating plantations could displace food production onto other lands or contribute to additional deforestation. Conversely, the creation of markets for forestry residues could help reduce the rate of conversion of forest systems to agricultural use. To be conservative, however, we recommend that this potential positive impact be excluded from the quantified carbon removal outcome. Estimating indirect land use change resulting from feedstock demand will likely be difficult in practice and require careful economic modeling.",

      "description": "Since biochar degrades over time, any claim about the volume of total carbon removal facilitated by biochar should be accompanied by a clear claim about the associated time horizon of storage. The degradation of biochar applied to soils is contingent on the physical and chemical characteristics of biochar (see Biomass transformation) and the environment in which it is applied. Simple models relating biochar elemental ratios or volatile matter content to its stability may provide some indication of expected longevity of carbon storage, and by extension, the mass of carbon remaining in biochar over a specified time horizon. However, these models do not extrapolate with confidence over long time horizons or capture variability critical environmental factors that drive degradation like climate, temperature, moisture, soil type and texture, and microbial and fungal communities. Estimates of carbon lost from biochar should also take into account the potential for biochar\u2019s environment to change through time, for example by eroding off of agricultural fields or migrating through the soil column. Better characterizing biochar degradation is an active area of research. Note that although this component specifically focuses on biochar applied to soils, biochar could be stored (e.g. buried at depth) or productized (e.g. embedded in concrete) in a way that constrains degradation uncertainty.",

Theoretically, these impacts could increase or decrease soil organic carbon (SOC) storage (i.e. the priming effect), and are highly dependent on the physical and chemical properties of the applied biochar (see Biomass Transformation) and environment of application. There is relatively little research on these potential interactions to date, and they merit further exploration. If biochar application increases SOC storage beyond the carbon embodied in the biochar, we recommend that these changes not be used to counterbalance project-related fossil CO\u2082 emissions nor counted as additional durable carbon removal due to the impermanence of soil carbon storage.",
