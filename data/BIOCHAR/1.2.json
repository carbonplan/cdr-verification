            "description": "Transforming biomass into biochar via pyrolysis results in the direct emission of some portion of the carbon originally contained in the biomass feedstock. Quantifying the emissions during pyrolysis supports the assessment of how efficiently a given process converts biomass into long-term carbon storage and/or useful co-products. Biomass carbon lost during biomass transformation can be estimated by comparing the mass of carbon in the produced biochar to the mass of carbon contained in the biomass feedstock (See Biomass feedstock). The carbon content of the biochar can be directly sampled and converted to CO\u2082e using a default factor. This quantity can also be checked for consistency against operational data and expected conversion efficiency of the pyrolyzer. In addition to characterizing carbon content, a biochar sampling protocol should characterize the physical and chemical characteristics that inform the expected durability of biochar (e.g. total organic carbon and soluble organic carbon content, elemental ratios, pH, volatile and ash content, porosity; see Biochar degradation) and the impact of biochar application (e.g. water retention, surface area, surface charge, liming capacity, heavy metal content, or polyaromatic hydrocarbon and polychlorinated biphenyls; see Soil carbon impacts, Change in agricultural lime use, Change in fertilizer use, Change in agricultural yields). If the transformation process produces other carbon-containing products, such as bio-oil or tar, we recommend the embodied carbon be conservatively classified as \u201cemitted\u201d unless the product has a clearly defined path to durable storage. The conversion efficiency, structure, and chemistry of produced biochar are contingent on the specific feedstock and operating conditions of the pyrolyzer, and a sampling regime should be designed accordingly.",

The degradation of biochar applied to soils is contingent on the physical and chemical characteristics of biochar (see Biomass transformation) and the environment in which it is applied. Simple models relating biochar elemental ratios or volatile matter content to its stability may provide some indication of expected longevity of carbon storage, and by extension, the mass of carbon remaining in biochar over a specified time horizon. However, these models do not extrapolate with confidence over long time horizons or capture variability in critical environmental factors that drive degradation, like climate, temperature, moisture, soil type and texture, and microbial and fungal communities. Estimates of carbon lost from biochar should also take into account the potential for biochar\u2019s environment to change through time, for example by eroding off of agricultural fields or migrating through the soil column. Better characterizing biochar degradation is an active area of research.
