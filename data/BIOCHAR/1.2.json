Quantifying the emissions during pyrolysis supports the assessment of how efficiently a given process converts biomass into long-term carbon storage and/or useful co-products. Biomass transformation emissions can be estimated by comparing the mass of carbon in the produced biochar to the mass of carbon contained in the biomass feedstock (See Biomass feedstock). The carbon content of the biochar can be directly sampled and converted to CO\u2082e using a default factor. This quantity can also be checked for consistency against operational data and expected conversion efficiency of the pyrolyzer. In addition to characterizing carbon content, a biochar sampling protocol should characterize the physical and chemical characteristics that inform the expected durability of biochar (e.g. total organic carbon and soluble organic carbon content, elemental ratios, pH, volatile and ash content, porosity; see Biochar degradation) and the impact of biochar application (e.g. water retention, surface area, surface charge, liming capacity, heavy metal content, or polyaromatic hydrocarbon and polychlorinated biphenyls; see Soil carbon impacts, Change in agricultural lime use, Change in fertilizer use, Change in agricultural yields). The conversion efficiency, structure, and chemistry of produced biochar are contingent on the specific feedstock and operating conditions of the pyrolyzer, and a sampling regime should be designed accordingly.",

The degradation of biochar applied to soils is contingent on the physical and chemical characteristics of biochar (see Biomass transformation) and the environment in which it is applied. Simple models relating biochar elemental ratios or volatile matter content to its stability may provide some indication of expected longevity of carbon storage, and by extension, the mass of carbon remaining in biochar over a specified time horizon. However, these models do not extrapolate with confidence over long time horizons or capture variability critical environmental factors that drive degradation like climate, temperature, moisture, soil type and texture, and microbial and fungal communities. Estimates of carbon lost from biochar should also take into account the potential for biochar\u2019s environment to change through time, for example by eroding off of agricultural fields or migrating through the soil column. Better characterizing biochar degradation is an active area of research. Note that although this component specifically focuses on biochar applied to soils, biochar could be stored (e.g. buried at depth) or productized (e.g. embedded in concrete) in a way that constrains degradation uncertainty.",

Current feedstock uses can be evaluated on a project-by-project basis, and the carbon impact of replacements can be estimated via lifecycle assessments. We recommend accounting for feedstock replacement emissions that involve existing feedstock uses rather than potential future uses. For example, agricultural feedstocks for biochar should be evaluated based on their current uses (e.g. for animal feed or soil nutrients) rather than potential future uses that are not practiced today (e.g. potential use for bioenergy). The counterfactual for existing utilization should be flexible, and re-evaluated in the future if prevailing practices change.",

Biochar use could potentially reduce the need to apply lime \u2013 its liming capacity can be characterized as a chemical property of produced biochar (see Biomass transformation). Any change in lime use because of biochar application requires accounting for the corresponding change in both life cycle emissions and carbon removal. We consider the uncertainty due to changing lime use to be medium (5-20%) because lime weathering efficiency may be reasonably well-known at sites that have applied lime for years, but tracking the fate of lime-derived carbon remains a challenge.
