      "comments": "Some fraction of the deployed biomass may not successfully sink to the ocean floor or might not sink at suitable depth for long-term storage. This could be a result of biomass being shed during the sinking process, which could be modeled as a function of biomass type and sinking configuration based on field observations. For biomass that sinks after some period of floating in the open ocean (e.g. biomass-based buoys), the possibility that biomass may end up being beached or sinking in areas that do not result in permanent storage (e.g. shallow waters or areas of upwelling) must also be considered. Existing surface ocean transport models could be validated based on GPS-based observational data.",

If the counterfactual fate of the biomass feedstock would have resulted in medium-to-long term carbon storage \u2014 for example in landfills, in slow degrading environments, or in soils \u2014 the mass of stored carbon in the counterfactual does not count as additional carbon removal until counterfactual emissions would have occurred.",

      "comments": "If a biomass feedstock currently serves a function that will need to be replaced if used for sinking, any emissions associated with the replacement must be considered.  For example, if agricultural waste is currently used as animal feed or left on the fields to contribute to nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in soils, using that agricultural waste for sinking would result in new demand for feed or fertilizer, respectively. Current feedstock uses can be evaluated on a project-by-project basis, and the carbon impact of replacements can be estimated via lifecycle assessments.",

      "comments": "Any emissions associated with indirect land use change as a result of feedstock demand must be considered. For example, paying farmers for agricultural waste will likely increase the profitability of their operations, and could result in increased acres planted. Directly growing energy crops or creating plantations may displace food production onto other lands and contribute to deforestation. Conversely, the creation of markets for forestry residues could help reduce the rate of conversion of forest systems to agricultural use, however to be conservative, this potential positive impact should not be counted toward the quantified carbon removal outcome. Estimating indirect land use change resulting from feedstock demand will likely require careful economic modeling.",

The embodied emissions of non-consumed project equipment and infrastructure must also be considered, amortized over the expected lifetime of operation. There are not yet consistent best practices around whether or how to account for the embodied emissions of equipment or infrastructure that is used but not owned by the project. Transparency around these boundary assumptions, as well as the data sources and associated uncertainties across the board, is necessary for LCA consistency and comparability.",

The estimated timescale of this ventilation is dependent on the location of sinking and depth achieved, which must be characterized at the project level, but can be informed by models.",
