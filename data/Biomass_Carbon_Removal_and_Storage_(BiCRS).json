      "comments": "The mass of biomass material injected for geologic storage \u2014 or used as an input for another storage process \u2014 can be measured directly as a metered output from the biomass transformation system (e.g. a pyrolyzer) and as a metered input to the storage system, and converted to carbon using a default carbon content factor. This quantity can also be checked for consistency against the measured mass of biomass feedstock, and operational data from the biomass transformation system.",

      "comments": "For terrestrial geologic storage, fugitive emissions (or migrating bio-oil) can be directly monitored during and after the injection period, though this would be more challenging for subseafloor reservoirs. If geologic storage results in functionally stable form on a short timescale \u2014 for example, via subsurface mineralization of CO2 or demonstration that injected bio-oil will not break down into CO2 and biomethane under subsurface conditions  \u2014 fugitive emissions associated with the full lifetime of storage may be estimated based on direct observations of the storage reservoir. If however the integrity of geologic storage requires ongoing monitoring and maintenance, for example if the degradation dynamics of bio-oil are unknown under storage conditions, the potential for future fugitive emissions must be modeled.",

      "comments": "While nearly all biomass carbon eventually makes its way back to the atmosphere, the effective drawdown from BiCRS occurs when the CO2 would otherwise have ended up in the atmosphere. If the counterfactual fate of the biomass feedstock would have resulted in medium-to-long term carbon storage \u2014 for example in landfills, in slow degrading environments, or in soils \u2014 the mass of stored carbon in the counterfactual does not count as additional carbon removal until counterfactual emissions would have occurred.",

      "comments": "If a biomass feedstock currently serves a function that will need to be replaced if used for BiCRS, any emissions associated with the replacement must be considered.  For example, if agricultural waste is currently used as animal feed or left on the fields to contribute to nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in soils, using that agricultural waste for BiCRS would result in new demand for feed or fertilizer, respectively. Current feedstock uses can be evaluated on a project-by-project basis, and the carbon impact of replacements can be estimated via lifecycle assessments.",

      "comments": "Any emissions associated with indirect land use change as a result of feedstock demand must be considered. For example, paying farmers for agricultural waste will likely increase the profitability of their operations, and could result in increased acres planted. Directly growing energy crops or creating plantations may displace food production onto other lands and contribute to deforestation. Conversely, the creation of markets for forestry residues could help reduce the rate of conversion of forest systems to agricultural use, however to be conservative, this potential positive impact should not be counted toward the quantified carbon removal outcome. Estimating indirect land use change resulting from BiCRS feedstock demand will likely require careful economic modeling.",
