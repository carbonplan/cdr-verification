      "description": "The mass of CO\u2082 injected for geologic storage, or used as an input for another storage process (e.g. mineralization in concrete), can be measured directly as a metered output from the DAC system and a metered input to the storage system. It can also be checked for consistency against operational data from the CO\u2082 capture system. We assume here that injected CO\u2082 is not used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). In the case of EOR, any GHG emissions associated with enhanced oil recovery and fuel use would have to be accounted for, as well as additionality questions about the appropriate baseline against which to credit the project.",

      "description": "For terrestrial geologic storage, leakage can be directly monitored during and after the injection period, though this is more challenging for subseafloor reservoirs. If geologic storage results in a functionally stable form on a short timescale \u2014 for example, via subsurface mineralization \u2014 fugitive emissions associated with the full lifetime of storage may be estimated based on direct observations of the storage reservoir. If instead the integrity of geologic storage requires ongoing monitoring and maintenance \u2014 for example with the injection of supercritical CO\u2082 \u2014 the potential for future fugitive emissions must be modeled. In the latter framework, we consider the potential for future leakage as a durability uncertainty rather than a leakage uncertainty (see Storage Monitoring and Maintenance). For alternative storage systems, like mineralization in concrete, it is possible to directly measure the conversion of input CO\u2082 into a functionally stable form and therefore the total leakage from the storage system.",

The embodied emissions of non-consumed project equipment and infrastructure must also be considered, amortized over the expected lifetime of operation. There are not yet consistent best practices around whether or how to account for the embodied emissions of equipment or infrastructure that is used but not owned by the project. Transparency around boundary assumptions, data sources, and uncertainties is critical for LCA consistency and comparability.",
