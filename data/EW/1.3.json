  "pathway_description": "Enhanced weathering (EW) is a process that speeds up the chemical reactions between rocks, water, and air to remove CO\u2082 from the atmosphere. Here, we specifically consider EW performed by spreading finely ground rock on agricultural soils. This pathway is VCL 3, meaning that current quantification capacity can establish net carbon removal occurred, but significant uncertainties remain. You can learn about how this pathway has been updated since initial publication [here](https://carbonplan.org/blog/enhanced-weathering-update).",

Realizable drawdown potential depends on mineral composition, particle size, kinetics, and applied volumes. It is also possible to directly analyze rock composition, which is critical not only for carbon accounting but also for tracking other ecosystem and agricultural impacts. Applied volume can be confirmed via an audit of operational records.",

      "description": "The effects of enhanced weathering should be understood as an overall shift in CO\u2082 fluxes as a result of introducing alkalinity to the system through rock weathering. While most applied minerals will ultimately weather, enhanced weathering approaches should only be credited when the impact on atmospheric CO\u2082 actually occurs. The rate of rock weathering, and therefore alkalinity introduction, depends on many factors including rock type, particle size, soil type, ambient temperature, precipitation, and irrigation. At a given point in time, it may be possible to measure how much rock has weathered via elemental analysis or by tracking changes in the concentration of tracer components that originate in the applied rocks and persist in the soil after rock weathering. Rock weathering may be facilitated by different sources of acid (carbonic or non-carbonic) and result in different weathering products, which can each have unique impacts on system CO\u2082 fluxes (see Terrestrial carbonate precipitation, Secondary mineral formation, and Neutralization of non-carbonic acid for more details.) If rock is weathered by carbonic acid, a potential product is dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). To inform a lower bound on rock weathering and characterize how much additional DIC is leaving the site because of the weathering, effluent from the weathering site can be continuously monitored to detect changes in the carbonic acid system. These changes can be constrained by monitoring any two components of the carbonic acid system: pH, total alkalinity (TA), partial pressure of CO\u2082 (pCO\u2082), or dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Both approaches \u2014 monitoring of the rock in the weathering site and monitoring the effluent leaving the weathering site \u2014 are areas of active innovation.",

Non-carbonic sources of acidity in the soil may include protons associated with mineral and organic surfaces and other sources of acidity from organic acids, nitrogen transformations, or sulfide mineral oxidation. If applied rock is weathered by non-carbonic acid that would have otherwise caused outgassing downstream, it may be appropriate to count this avoided outgassing toward the net carbon drawdown of the enhanced weathering intervention depending on how confidently the counterfactual can be characterized and how quickly the outgassing would have otherwise occurred.",

Once in surface waters, outgassing (evasion) might occur as groundwater equilibrates with the atmosphere or experiences pH shifts. Outgassing may also occur as surface waters interact with the surface ocean. Ultimately, the effects of enhanced weathering should be understood as an overall shift in CO\u2082 fluxes from the system as a result of the alkalinity introduced by rock weathering. Any changes in outgassing in the project scenario as compared to the counterfactual should be accounted for. The long timescale and large spatial scale of this process makes it difficult to study directly, but regional models could inform baseline- and project-scenario evasion estimates.",

This process counteracts most or all of the carbon storage associated with weathering carbonate rock, and around half of the storage associated with silicate rock weathering. The carbonate precipitation process occurs slowly and is unlikely to have a significant impact on estimates of carbon storage on decadal to millennial timescales. However on geologic timescales, it is an important process to characterize.",

      "description": "In agricultural contexts, fine grained carbonate limestone (agricultural lime) is commonly applied to raise the pH of acidic soils. As the lime weathers, it may serve as a sink or source of carbon dioxide depending on the time frame considered, the extent of strong acid weathering, and the degree of secondary carbonate precipitation, among other factors (see corresponding pathway components). Weathering of a mole of carbonate can remove one mole of carbon dioxide, half of that amount removed through silicate weathering. Any change in lime use because of an enhanced weathering deployment, including replacing lime with another feedstock, requires accounting for the corresponding change in both life cycle emissions and carbon removal. We consider the uncertainty due to changing lime use to be medium (5-20%) because lime weathering efficiency may be reasonably well-known at sites that have applied lime for years, but tracking the fate of lime-derived carbon remains a challenge. If no liming occurs prior to enhanced weathering deployment, the uncertainty of the liming counterfactual is not applicable.",

      "description": "Adding minerals to soils has the potential to induce changes to soil carbon, including by affecting pH or impacting plant or microbial activity. Theoretically, these impacts could increase or decrease soil organic carbon (SOC) storage (i.e. the priming effect). There is relatively little research on these potential interactions to date, and they merit further exploration. Due to the high uncertainty of these potential effects, we recommend this component not be included in the accounting of net carbon removal. If mineral application does increase SOC storage, we recommend that these changes not be used to counterbalance project-related fossil CO\u2082 emissions nor counted as additional durable carbon removal due to the impermanence of soil carbon storage.",
