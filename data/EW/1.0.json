  "pathway_description": "Enhanced weathering (EW) is a process that speeds up the chemical reactions between rocks, water, and air to remove CO\u2082 from the atmosphere. Here, we specifically consider EW performed by spreading finely ground rock on agricultural soils. This pathway is VCL 3, meaning that current quantification capacity can establish net carbon removal occurred, but significant uncertainties remain.",

      "description": "It is possible to calculate potential atmospheric removal by assuming full dissolution of the applied rocks. Realizable drawdown potential depends on mineral composition, particle size, kinetics, and applied volumes. It is also possible to directly analyze rock composition, which is critical not only for carbon accounting but also for tracking other ecosystem and agricultural impacts. Applied volume can be confirmed via an audit of operational records.",

      "description": "The rate of mineral weathering depends on many factors, including rock particle size, soil type, ambient temperature, precipitation, and irrigation. While most of the applied minerals will ultimately weather, the effective CO\u2082 drawdown should only be credited when the weathering actually occurs. At a given point in time, it is possible to measure how much rock has weathered via elemental analysis or by tracking changes in the concentration of tracer elements that originate in the applied rocks and persist in the soil after rock weathering. However, these measurements do not tell one what portion of the alkalinity released through weathering has resulted in stored CO\u2082 (see Alkalinity Loss, Secondary Mineral Formation, and Secondary Precipitation for more details). Alternatively, the pH and alkalinity of the water leaving the weathering site can be continuously measured to provide an estimate of how much alkalinity originating from the weathered rock has resulted in stored CO\u2082 that is exported from the system as dissolved inorganic carbon. This approach provides an upper bound on the non-weathered portion of rock and, if used as the primary estimate of drawdown, could simplify the overall quantification approach. Both approaches \u2014 monitoring of the rock in the weathering site, and monitoring of the alkalinity leaving the weathering site \u2014 are areas of active innovation.",

      "description": "Mineral weathering releases cations that increase the alkalinity of soil pore water to facilitate CO\u2082 storage. However, not all of the released cations will immediately react with carbonic acid and result in CO\u2082 storage. For example, the released cations may instead react with other sources of acidity in the soil (e.g. protons associated with mineral and organic surfaces, denitrification, or sulfide oxidation), thereby reducing total CO\u2082 drawdown. The released cations may also be absorbed by vegetation if plants react to a marginal increase in availability with a marginal increase in uptake. The quantity of lost alkalinity is also reflected in the difference between the quantity of rock that has weathered and the quantity of alkalinity that has left the weathering site.

Once in surface waters, outgassing (evasion) might occur, for example as a result of shifts in pH.
