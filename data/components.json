Current feedstock uses can be evaluated on a project-by-project basis, and the carbon impact of replacements can be estimated via lifecycle assessment. We recommend accounting for feedstock replacement emissions that involve existing feedstock uses rather than potential future uses.

As the lime weathers, it may serve as a sink or source of carbon dioxide depending on the time frame considered, the extent of strong acid weathering, and the degree of secondary carbonate precipitation, among other factors. Weathering of a mole of carbonate can remove one mole of carbon dioxide. Any change in lime use because of a CDR deployment requires accounting for the corresponding change in carbon removal. Lime weathering efficiency may be reasonably well-known at sites that have applied lime for years, but tracking the fate of lime-derived carbon remains a challenge. If no liming occurs prior to a deployment, or the CDR deployment does not change liming behavior, the uncertainty of the liming counterfactual is not applicable.",

    "description": "Since biochar degrades over time, any claim about the volume of total carbon removal facilitated by biochar should be accompanied by a clear claim about the associated time horizon of storage. The degradation of biochar applied to soils is contingent on the physical and chemical characteristics of biochar (see Biomass transformation) and the environment in which it is applied. Simple models relating biochar elemental ratios or volatile matter content to its stability may provide some indication of expected longevity of carbon storage, and by extension, the mass of carbon remaining in biochar over a specified time horizon. However, these models do not extrapolate with confidence over long time horizons or capture variability critical environmental factors that drive degradation like climate, temperature, moisture, soil type and texture, and microbial and fungal communities. Estimates of carbon lost from biochar should also take into account the potential for biochar\u2019s environment to change through time, for example by eroding off of agricultural fields or migrating through the soil column. Better characterizing biochar degradation is an active area of research.

    "description": "If alkalinity is added the ocean directly (e.g. via aqueous NaOH), the total alkalinity released it can be directly measured. Environmental conditions and alkalinity addition dynamics may result in different fractions of carbonate (CO\u2083\u207b\u00b2) versus bicarbonate (HCO\u2083\u207b). This fractionation impacts the total uptake of atmospheric CO\u2082. Overall CO\u2082 uptake efficiency can be estimated using seawater chemistry modeling software and the equation presented in [Renforth & Henderson (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1002/2016RG000533). These estimates could also be validated by measurements of bicarbonate concentrations or total alkalinity in the water column. The conversion of alkalinity to CO\u2082 removal is estimated to be 70-95% on a mol to mol basis.",

A portion of exposed and buried carbonates may undergo weathering over time. If and when carbonates weather, there is an additional shift in CO\u2082 fluxes as a result of introducing alkalinity to the system and storing additional CO\u2082 as bicarbonate. This process approximately doubles the associated CO\u2082 storage. Although most carbonates will ultimately weather, this process should only be credited when the impact on atmospheric CO\u2082 actually occurs and must take into account the full suite of uncertainties related to quantifying weathering outcomes (see the Enhanced Weathering pathway). In the absence of clear measurement of carbonate weathering, we recommend alkaline waste mineralization approaches only consider and credit the mineral phase of CO\u2082 storage.",

    "description": "The effects of enhanced weathering should be understood as an overall shift in CO\u2082 fluxes as a result of introducing alkalinity to the system through rock weathering. While most applied minerals will ultimately weather, enhanced weathering approaches should only be credited when the impact on atmospheric CO\u2082 actually occurs. The rate of rock weathering, and therefore alkalinity introduction, depends on many factors including rock type, particle size, soil type, ambient temperature, precipitation, and irrigation. At a given point in time, it may be possible to measure how much rock has weathered via elemental analysis or by tracking changes in the concentration of tracer elements that originate in the applied rocks and persist in the soil after rock weathering. Rock weathering may be facilitated by different sources of acid (carbonic or non-carbonic) and result in different weathering products, which can each have unique impacts on system CO\u2082 fluxes. If rock is weathered by carbonic acid, a potential product is dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). To inform a lower bound on rock weathering and characterize how much additional DIC is leaving the site because of the weathering, effluent from the weathering site can be continuously monitored to detect changes in the carbonic acid system. These changes can be constrained by monitoring any two components of the carbonic acid system: pH, total alkalinity (TA), partial pressure of CO\u2082 (pCO\u2082), or dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Both approaches \u2014 monitoring of the rock in the weathering site and monitoring the effluent leaving the weathering site \u2014 are areas of active innovation.",

    "description": "The formation of terrestrial carbonates depends on the type of primary mineral dissolving, carbonate saturation state, pH, and other local environmental conditions. In natural systems, terrestrial carbonates can be quite durable, persisting for many thousands of years as conditions permit. In enhanced weathering deployments, these minerals could be much less durable. If a deployment creates the conditions that allow terrestrial carbonates to form and persist, for example by raising the soil pH, then these minerals are likely to dissolve after the deployment activity stops. The uncertainty around terrestrial carbonate durability is not included in the calculation of this pathway's Verification Confidence Level (VCL) because it is also captured by the Terrestrial carbonate precipitation component.",

    "description": "The formation of solid carbonates decreases CO\u2082 drawdown relative to the aqueous reactions that result in alkalinity run-off. It therefore must be considered if drawdown is being estimated on the basis of direct observation of mineral weathering rather than via estimation of alkalinity run-off. Terrestrial carbonate precipitation depends on the type of primary mineral dissolving, carbonate saturation state, and other local environmental conditions.",
