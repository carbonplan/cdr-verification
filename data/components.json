Non-carbonic sources of acidity in the soil may include protons associated with mineral and organic surfaces and other sources of acidity from organic acids, nitrogen transformations, or sulfide mineral oxidation. If applied rock is weathered by non-carbonic acid that would have otherwise caused outgassing downstream, it may be appropriate to count this avoided outgassing toward the net carbon drawdown of the Enhanced Weathering intervention depending on how confidently the counterfactual can be characterized and how quickly the outgassing would have otherwise occurred.",

    "description": "The effects of enhanced weathering should be understood as an overall shift in CO\u2082 fluxes as a result of introducing alkalinity to the system through rock weathering. While most applied minerals will ultimately weather, enhanced weathering approaches should only be credited when the impact on atmospheric CO\u2082 actually occurs. The rate of rock weathering, and therefore alkalinity introduction, depends on many factors including rock type, particle size, soil type, ambient temperature, precipitation, and irrigation. At a given point in time, it may be possible to measure how much rock has weathered via elemental analysis or by tracking changes in the concentration of tracer elements that originate in the applied rocks and persist in the soil after rock weathering. Rock weathering may be facilitated by different sources of acid (carbonic or non-carbonic) and result in different weathering products, which can each have unique impacts on system CO\u2082 fluxes. If rock is weathered by carbonic acid, a potential product is dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). To inform a lower bound on rock weathering and characterize how much additional DIC is leaving the site because of the weathering, effluent from the weathering site can be continuously monitored to detect changes in the carbonic acid system. These changes can be constrained by monitoring any two components of the carbonic acid system: pH, total alkalinity (TA), partial pressure of CO\u2082 (pCO\u2082), or dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Both approaches \u2014 monitoring of the rock in the weathering site and monitoring the effluent leaving the weathering site \u2014 are areas of active innovation.",

The precise dispersal of modified seawater, its residence time at the surface, and hence the associated completeness of air-sea gas equilibration is dependent on the location and timing of the modification, and is hard to directly observe. In-situ measurements can potentially track post-deployment changes in pCO\u2082, pH, and DIC and deploy water mass tracers to help validate models of plume dispersal and atmospheric CO\u2082 drawdown, though the sensitivity and cost of sensors may be a challenge. Further, oceanographic models can be used to develop probabilistic estimates of equilibration efficiencies for particular injection sites, contingent on seasonal or interannual variations in forcing regimes. Typical gas exchange timescales of equilibration for the surface ocean and atmosphere are on the order of months to years.",

The degradation of biochar applied to soils is contingent on the physical and chemical characteristics of biochar (see Biomass transformation) and the environment in which it is applied. Simple models relating biochar elemental ratios or volatile matter content to its stability may provide some indication of expected longevity of carbon storage, and by extension, the mass of carbon remaining in biochar over a specified time horizon. However, these models do not extrapolate with confidence over long time horizons or capture variability critical environmental factors that drive degradation like climate, temperature, moisture, soil type and texture, and microbial and fungal communities. Estimates of carbon lost from biochar should also take into account the potential for biochar\u2019s environment to change through time, for example by eroding off of agricultural fields or migrating through the soil column. Better characterizing biochar degradation is an active area of research. Note that although this component specifically focuses on biochar applied to soils, biochar could be stored (e.g. buried at depth) or productized (e.g. embedded in concrete) in a way that constrains degradation uncertainty.

    "description": "Carbonates may remain exposed to the atmosphere or be buried over time depending on the location and approach. A portion of exposed and buried carbonates may undergo weathering over time. If and when carbonates weather, there is an additional shift in CO\u2082 fluxes as a result of introducing alkalinity to the system and storing additional CO\u2082 as bicarbonate. This process approximately doubles the associated CO\u2082 storage. Although most carbonates will ultimately weather, this process should only be credited when the impact on atmospheric CO\u2082 actually occurs and must take into account the full suite of uncertainties related to quantifying weathering outcomes (see the Enhanced Weathering pathway). In the absence of clear measurement of carbonate weathering, we recommend alkaline waste mineralization approaches only consider and credit the mineral phase of CO\u2082 storage.",

It can also be checked for consistency against operational data from the DOR system and characterization of the seawater effluent that is depleted of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The quantity of CO\u2082 directly removed from seawater may not be equal to the quantity of CO\u2082 stored (see Leakage) or the quantity of CO\u2082 indirectly removed by atmospheric drawdown (see Air sea gas exchange). Direct removal of CO\u2082 from seawater produces DIC-depleted seawater and results in subsequent atmospheric carbon removal by inducing air-sea gas exchange. Thus, the quantity of CO\u2082 removed directly from seawater must be clearly quantified and validated as a separate measurement from CO\u2082 storage or atmospheric CO\u2082 drawdown. ",

Once in surface waters, outgassing (evasion) might occur as groundwater equilibrates with the atmosphere or experiences pH shifts. Outgassing may also occur as surface waters interact with the surface ocean. Ultimately, the effects of enhanced weathering should be understood as an overall shift in CO\u2082 fluxes from the system as a result of the alkalinity introduced by rock weathering. Any changes in outgassing in the project scenario as compared to the counterfactual should be accounted for.

For example, if agricultural waste is currently used as animal feed or left on the fields to contribute to nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in soils, using that agricultural waste for CDR could result in new demand for feed or fertilizer, respectively. Current feedstock uses can be evaluated on a project-by-project basis, and the carbon impact of replacements can be estimated via lifecycle assessments. We recommend accounting for feedstock replacement emissions that involve existing feedstock uses rather than potential future uses. For example, agricultural feedstocks used for CDR should be evaluated based on their current uses (e.g. for animal feed or soil nutrients) rather than potential future uses that are not practiced today (e.g. potential use for bioenergy). The counterfactual for existing utilization should be flexible, and re-evaluated in the future if prevailing practices change.",

    "description": "Any emissions associated with indirect land use change as a result of feedstock demand must be considered. For example, paying farmers for agricultural waste will likely increase the profitability of their operations, and could result in an increase in acres planted. Directly growing energy crops or creating plantations could displace food production onto other lands and contribute to deforestation. Conversely, the creation of markets for forestry residues could help reduce the rate of conversion of forest systems to agricultural use. To be conservative, however, we recommend that this potential positive impact be excluded from the quantified carbon removal outcome. Estimating indirect land use change resulting from feedstock demand will likely be difficult in practice and require careful economic modeling.",

The estimated timescale of this ventilation is dependent on the location of sinking and depth achieved, which must be characterized at the project level but can be informed by models. Given these dynamics, any claim about the volume of total carbon removal facilitated by deepwater carbon storage should be accompanied by a clear claim about the associated time horizon of storage. Our uncertainty evaluation reflects the uncertainties associated with estimating carbon stored in the deep ocean for 1000+ years. Those interested storage on longer timescales may find it appropriate to adjust these uncertainties. ",
