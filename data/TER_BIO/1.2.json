This pathway is VCL 2-4, meaning that current quantification capacity can establish permanent carbon removal, but for certain approaches, very significant uncertainties remain.",

This could be a result of biomass being shed or consumed during the sinking process, which is a function of biomass type, sinking configuration, and sinking velocity. For biomass that sinks after some period of floating in the open ocean (e.g. biomass-based buoys), the possibility that biomass may end up being beached or sinking in areas that do not result in permanent storage (e.g. shallow waters or areas of upwelling) must also be considered. Modeling this behavior is likely to be challenging due to the difficulty of mimicking the free-floating behavior of biomass with monitoring equipment. Low uncertainty is likely only achieved in cases where biomass sinking is active and rapid.",

When the mixing dynamics of the reservoir bring the products of biomass decomposition back to the surface, they will equilibrate with the atmosphere. The estimated timescale of this outgassing is dependent on the location of sinking, the storage depth achieved, and local circulation dynamics. Any claim about the volume of total carbon removal from biomass sinking should therefore be accompanied by a clear claim about the associated time horizon of storage. Our evaluation reflects the uncertainties associated with estimating carbon stored for 1000+ years in a diversity of potential reservoirs, including the deep ocean or anoxic basins like the Black Sea. Characterizing the durability of carbon storage in these reservoirs is an area of active research, and those interested in storage in particular basins or on longer timescales may find it appropriate to adjust these uncertainties. Decomposition at depth could release non-CO2 gasses such as methane. Any GWP assumptions used to incorporate the outgassing of non-CO2 gasses into the calculation of net carbon removal should be transparently disclosed.",

For example, if agricultural waste is currently used as animal feed or left on the fields to contribute to nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium or to soil organic carbon, sinking that biomass could result in new demand for feed, fertilizer, or soil amendments, respectively. Current feedstock uses can be evaluated on a project-by-project basis, and the carbon impact of replacements can be estimated via lifecycle assessments. We recommend accounting for feedstock replacement emissions that involve existing feedstock uses rather than potential future uses. For example, agricultural feedstocks used for biomass sinking should be evaluated based on their current uses (e.g. for animal feed or soil nutrients) rather than potential future uses that are not practiced today (e.g. potential use for bioenergy). The counterfactual for existing utilization should be flexible, and re-evaluated in the future if prevailing practices change.",
