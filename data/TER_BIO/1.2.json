  "pathway_description": "Terrestrial Biomass Sinking uses plants or algae to remove CO\u2082 from the atmosphere via photosynthesis, and sinks that biomass into the deep ocean to achieve long-term carbon storage. In addition to the carbon removal and durability uncertainties mapped below, there are important uncertainties about the ecosystem impacts of this approach. This pathway is VCL 2-4, meaning that current quantification capacity can establish permanent carbon removal, but for certain approaches, very significant uncertainties remain.",

The feedstock quantity can be checked for consistency against operational records, and will form the basis for estimating feedstock-related upstream emissions (see Carbon storage counterfactual, Feedstock replacement emissions, and Market effects) as well as understanding the removal efficiency of the process. In addition to characterizing carbon content, a feedstock sampling protocol should characterize embodied nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. This enables an assessment of potential nutrient depletion and may inform the estimation of upstream emissions (see Feedstock replacement emissions). Any emissions associated with the process of biomass cultivation or procurement must be included in the project\u2019s lifecycle assessment (see Materials, Energy, and Non-CO\u2082 biomass emissions). The chemical and physical characteristics of the feedstock will also inform estimates of feedstock decomposition and outgassing (see Outgassing).",

      "description": "Some fraction of the deployed biomass may not successfully sink to a depth for long-term storage. This could be a result of biomass being shed or consumed during the sinking process, which is a function of biomass type, sinking configuration, and sinking velocity. Physical biomass loss during sinking should therefore be quantified for the specific biomass type and sinking configuration utilized based on field observations. For biomass that sinks after some period of floating in the open ocean (e.g. biomass-based buoys), the possibility that biomass may end up being beached or sinking in areas that do not result in permanent storage (e.g. shallow waters or areas of upwelling) must also be considered. Modeling this behavior is likely to be challenging due to the difficulty of mimicking the free-floating behavior of biomass with monitoring equipment. Negligible uncertainty is likely only achieved in cases where biomass sinking is active and rapid.",

      "description": "Sunk biomass will likely decompose, and the resulting dissolved products will mix in the water reservoir. When the mixing dynamics of the reservoir bring decomposition products back to the surface, they will equilibrate with the atmosphere, which could result in the outgassing of CO\u2082 or other greenhouse gases. The estimated timescale of this outgassing is dependent on the location of sinking, the storage depth achieved, and local stratification and circulation dynamics. Any claim about the volume of total carbon removal from biomass sinking should therefore be accompanied by a clear claim about the portion of biomass that is assumed to remain in solid-phase storage (see Solid Phase Deepwater Storage) and a clear disclosure of the time horizon over which outgassing dynamics are considered. In the absence of clear evidence that the sunk biomass resists decomposition, it is conservative to assume that all sunk biomass is remineralized at the bottom of the reservoir in which it is sunk. Our evaluation reflects the uncertainties associated with estimating carbon stored for 1000+ years in a diversity of potential reservoirs, including the deep ocean or anoxic basins like the Black Sea. Characterizing the durability of carbon storage in these reservoirs is an area of active research, and those interested in particular basins or on longer storage timescales may find it appropriate to adjust these uncertainties. The outgassing of such non-CO\u2082 gasses such as methane, nitrous oxide, and sulfide should be quantified, and any GWP assumptions used to incorporate non-CO\u2082 outgassing into the calculation of net carbon removal should be transparently disclosed.",

For example, if agricultural waste is currently used as animal feed or left on the fields to contribute to nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in soils, using that agricultural waste for CDR could result in new demand for feed or fertilizer, respectively. Current feedstock uses can be evaluated on a project-by-project basis, and the carbon impact of replacements can be estimated via lifecycle assessment. We recommend accounting for feedstock replacement emissions that involve existing feedstock uses rather than potential future uses. For example, agricultural feedstocks used for CDR should be evaluated based on their current uses (e.g. for animal feed or soil nutrients) rather than potential future uses that are not practiced today. The counterfactual for existing utilization should be flexible, and re-evaluated in the future if prevailing practices change. This component may not apply in cases where carbon is purpose grown.",
