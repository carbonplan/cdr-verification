  "pathway_description": "Ocean biomass sinking uses macroalgae to remove CO\u2082 from surface ocean, indirectly resulting in the removal of CO\u2082 from the atmosphere. The biomass is sunk into the deep ocean to achieve long-term carbon storage. Here, we specifically consider approaches that involve harvesting the biomass before sinking it. This pathway is VCL 3, meaning that current quantification capacity can establish net carbon removal occurred, but significant uncertainties remain.",

This is an important factor to consider both in relation to broader ecosystem impacts and for quantifying carbon management outcomes. While only a fraction of the carbon removed by biological activity in the surface ocean will result in permanent carbon storage, we recommend a conservative stance of counting any decrease in surface ocean productivity against estimates of carbon removal achieved.",

      "description": "Atmospheric uptake is reduced if dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) depleted water is transferred from the surface ocean before either increasing the uptake of atmospheric CO\u2082 or decreasing the outgassing of CO\u2082 to the atmosphere. The precise dispersal of DIC-depleted water, its residence time at the surface, and hence the associated completeness of air-sea gas equilibration is dependent on the location and timing of the kelp growth, and is hard to directly observe. In-situ measurements can potentially track post-growth changes in pCO\u2082, pH, and DIC and deploy water mass tracers to help validate models of atmospheric CO\u2082 drawdown, though the sensitivity and cost of sensors may be a challenge. Further, oceanographic models can be used to develop probabilistic estimates of equilibration efficiencies for specific locations, contingent on seasonal or interannual variations in forcing regimes. Typical gas exchange timescales of equilibration for the surface ocean and atmosphere are on the order of months to years.",

      "description": "Sunk biomass will likely decompose, and the resulting dissolved products will mix in the water reservoir. When the mixing dynamics of the reservoir bring decomposition products back to the surface, they will equilibrate with the atmosphere, which could result in the outgassing of CO\u2082 or other greenhouse gases. The estimated timescale of this outgassing is dependent on the location of sinking, the storage depth achieved, and local stratification and circulation dynamics. Any claim about the volume of total carbon removal from biomass sinking should therefore be accompanied by a clear claim about the portion of biomass that is assumed to remain in solid-phase storage and a clear disclosure of the time horizon over which outgassing dynamics are considered. In the absence of clear evidence that the sunk biomass resists decomposition, it is conservative to assume that all sunk biomass is remineralized at the bottom of the reservoir in which it is sunk. The outgassing of such non-CO\u2082 gasses such as methane, nitrous oxide, and sulfide should be quantified, and any GWP assumptions used to incorporate non-CO\u2082 outgassing into the calculation of net carbon removal should be transparently disclosed. Our evaluation reflects the uncertainties associated with estimating carbon stored for 1000+ years, and those interested in longer storage timescales may find it appropriate to adjust these uncertainties.",

Depending on the circulation dynamics of the reservoir, some dissolved carbon may persist in stagnant deep water or stratified circulation. Any dissolved carbon that reaches the surface water will be brought into equilibrium with the atmosphere. The estimated timescale of this ventilation is dependent on the specific sinking location, which must be characterized at the project level but can be informed by models of the specific storage reservoir. The potential climate sensitivity of circulation dynamics is reservoir-specific and an outstanding area of uncertainty.
