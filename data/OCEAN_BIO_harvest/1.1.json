  "pathway_description": "Ocean Biomass Sinking uses macroalgae to remove CO\u2082 from surface ocean, indirectly resulting in the removal of CO\u2082 from the atmosphere. The biomass is sunk into the deep ocean to achieve long-term carbon storage. Here, we specifically consider approaches that involve harvesting the biomass before sinking it. This pathway is VCL 3, meaning that current quantification capacity can establish net carbon removal occurred, but significant uncertainties remain.",

This is an important factor to consider both in relation to broader ecosystem impacts and for quantifying carbon management outcomes. While only a fraction of the carbon removed by biological activity in the surface ocean will result in permanent carbon storage, we recommend a conservative stance of counting any decrease in surface ocean productivity against estimates of carbon removal achieved.",

      "description": "Atmospheric uptake is reduced if dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) depleted water is transferred from the surface ocean before either increasing the uptake of atmospheric CO\u2082 or decreasing the outgassing of CO\u2082 to the atmosphere. The precise dispersal of DIC-depleted water, its residence time at the surface, and hence the associated completeness of air-sea gas equilibration is dependent on the location and timing of the kelp growth, and is hard to directly observe. In-situ measurements can potentially track post-growth changes in pCO\u2082, pH, and DIC and deploy water mass tracers to help validate models of atmospheric CO\u2082 drawdown, though the sensitivity and cost of sensors may be a challenge. Further, oceanographic models can be used to develop probabilistic estimates of equilibration efficiencies for specific locations, contingent on seasonal or interannual variations in forcing regimes. Typical gas exchange timescales of equilibration for the surface ocean and atmosphere are on the order of months to years.",

The estimated timescale of this ventilation is dependent on the location of sinking and depth achieved, which must be characterized at the project level but can be informed by models. Given these dynamics, any claim about the volume of total carbon removal facilitated by deepwater carbon storage should be accompanied by a clear claim about the associated time horizon of storage. Our uncertainty evaluation reflects the uncertainties associated with estimating carbon stored in the deep ocean for 1000+ years. Those interested storage on longer timescales may find it appropriate to adjust these uncertainties.",
