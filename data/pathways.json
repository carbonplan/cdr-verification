We recommend accounting for feedstock replacement emissions that involve existing feedstock uses rather than potential future uses.

Conversely, the creation of markets for forestry residues could help reduce the rate of conversion of forest systems to agricultural use.

At a given point in time, it is possible to measure how much rock has weathered via elemental analysis or by tracking changes in the concentration of tracer elements that originate in the applied rocks and persist in the soil after rock weathering. However, these measurements do not tell one what portion of the alkalinity released through weathering has resulted in stored CO\u2082 (see Alkalinity Loss, Secondary Mineral Formation, and Secondary Precipitation for more details). Alternatively, the pH and alkalinity of the water leaving the weathering site can be continuously measured to provide an estimate of how much alkalinity originating from the weathered rock has resulted in stored CO\u2082 that is exported from the system as dissolved inorganic carbon. This approach provides an upper bound on the non-weathered portion of rock and, if used as the primary estimate of drawdown, could simplify the overall quantification approach.

This is important to characterize as the uptake of atmospheric CO\u2082 is reduced with the presence of more carbonate in the water. Overall CO\u2082 uptake efficiency can be estimated using seawater chemistry modeling software and the equation presented in [Renforth & Henderson (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1002/2016RG000533). These estimates could also be validated by measurements of bicarbonate concentrations or total alkalinity in the water column.

This is important to characterize as this precipitation results in CO\u2082 outgassing. Abiotic precipitation can be minimized by ensuring rapid dispersal relative to the rate of alkalinity addition, which is hard to control when adding alkalinity through mineral dissolution. There is [some](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2022.831587/full) [evidence](https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/bg-2022-126/) that that localized effects of mineral dissolution may trigger significant secondary precipitation.

Shifts in biotic calcification rates could occur in both coastal and open ocean waters, and could be tracked by measuring changes in total alkalinity over time and by sampling the water column to study changes in calcifier populations. In practice, quantifying the biotic calcification response to alkalinity addition may pose significant spatial and temporal challenges.",

The precise dispersal of alkalinity and associated efficiency of air-sea gas exchange is dependent on the location and timing of alkalinity deployment, and is hard to directly observe. In-situ measurements can potentially track post-deployment changes in pCO\u2082, pH, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to help validate models of plume dispersal and atmospheric CO\u2082 drawdown, though the sensitivity and cost of sensors may be a challenge.",

This effect could be quite small if plankton communities are primarily limited by nutrient availability, rather than DIC availability. However, it is possible for organisms to change their carbon-to-nutrient consumption ratios in response to changing environments, which could result in a shift toward increased carbon drawdown in the surface ocean. Because only a small fraction of this increased drawdown would result in permanent carbon storage in the deep ocean, we conservatively recommend this not be counted as additional sequestration or used to counterbalance project lifecycle emissions.",
