    "uncertainty_type": "The primary driver of uncertainty given the identified \u201cbest practice\u201d approaches to quantification: execution, scientific, or counterfactual.",
    "responsibility": "Should this uncertainty be primarily reduced through project-specific efforts, or system efforts, such as broader scientific research or cross-project coordination?",
    "included_in_accounting": "Whether or not the component is included in the calculation of total carbon removal. Components are excluded if they primarily inform permanence outcomes, or if they represent avoided emissions or temporary carbon removal co-benefits. ",
    "vcl": "The Verification Confidence Level (VCL) summarizes the uncertainty mapping and represents the extent to which net carbon removal and storage durability can be confidendently quantified using the best approaches available today on a scale of 1 (low confidence) to 5 (high confidence). Note that a low VCL corresponds with high component uncertainties, and vice versa. "
