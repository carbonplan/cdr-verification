  "pathway_description": "Biomass storage is a type of biomass carbon removal and storage (BiCRS) that uses photosynthesis to remove CO\u2082 from the atmosphere, and stores it (e.g. via burial) to prevent or slow decomposition. This pathway is VCL 1-4, meaning that current quantification capacity can establish permanent carbon removal for some approaches, but that for others, very significant uncertainties remain.",

The feedstock quantity can be checked for consistency against operational records, and will form the basis for estimating feedstock-related upstream emissions (see Carbon storage counterfactual, Feedstock replacement emissions, and Market effects) as well as understanding the removal efficiency of the process. In addition to characterizing carbon content, a feedstock sampling protocol should characterize embodied nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. This enables an assessment of potential nutrient depletion and may inform the estimation of upstream emissions (see Feedstock replacement emissions). Any emissions associated with the process of biomass cultivation or procurement must be included in the project\u2019s lifecycle assessment (see Materials, Energy, and Non-CO\u2082 biomass emissions). The chemical and physical characteristics of the feedstock will also inform estimates of feedstock decomposition (see Leakage).",

The amount of carbon lost from soils during a disturbance is dependent on carbon content of the soil, the amount of time soils are exposed at the surface, and the approach to reconstructing the soil profile. Soil carbon distribution varies by site and depth. Baseline soil carbon stocks should be established via soil sampling before any disturbance, and monitored after disturbance.",

In cases where decay is not fully prevented, leakage can be directly monitored with sensors in or around the storage site, but the potential for future leakage will likely be modeled. Modeling of future leakage must consider expected decomposition under optimal storage conditions, as well as suboptimal conditions (e.g. wetter, warmer, or more oxic than optimal), and should be informed by direct measurements. Long-tail risks like fire, pests, human disturbance, or physical changes to the storage site (e.g. erosion or settlement) must be estimated. GWP assumptions used to incorporate the leakage of non-CO\u2082 gasses into the calculation of net carbon removal should be transparently disclosed. Our uncertainty evaluation reflects the wide range of storage mechanisms being explored and the uncertainty associated with storing carbon for 1000+ years. Those interested in specific storage mechanisms, particular storage sites, or storage on longer timescales may find it appropriate to adjust these uncertainties.",

If the counterfactual fate of the biomass feedstock would have resulted in little to no carbon storage \u2014 for example, burning or rapid decomposition \u2014 any durable storage achieved represents additional carbon removal. If, however, the counterfactual fate of the biomass feedstock would have resulted in medium-to-long term carbon storage \u2014 for example in soils, slow-degradation environments like some landfills, or living ecosystems \u2014 the mass of stored carbon in the counterfactual should not count as additional carbon removal unless and until counterfactual emissions would have occurred. In the case that carbon storage in the project scenario is less than storage in the counterfactual, the project should not be considered to achieve carbon removal.

For example, if agricultural waste is currently used as animal feed or left on the fields to contribute to nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in soils, using that agricultural waste for CDR could result in new demand for feed or fertilizer, respectively. Current feedstock uses can be evaluated on a project-by-project basis, and the carbon impact of replacements can be estimated via lifecycle assessment. We recommend accounting for feedstock replacement emissions that involve existing feedstock uses rather than potential future uses. For example, agricultural feedstocks used for CDR should be evaluated based on their current uses (e.g. for animal feed or soil nutrients) rather than potential future uses that are not practiced today. The counterfactual for existing utilization should be flexible, and re-evaluated in the future if prevailing practices change. This component may not apply in cases where carbon is purpose grown.",

Estimating the system emissions resulting from new feedstock demand will likely be difficult in practice and require careful economic modeling that reflects the overall scale of new biomass demand.",
