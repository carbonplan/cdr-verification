  "pathway_description": "Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) adds alkalinity into the surface ocean to enhance its ability to uptake and store atmospheric CO\u2082. Here, we specifically consider OAE that is facilitated by adding solid or semi-solid minerals to the ocean which dissolve to enhance alkalinity. This pathway is VCL 1-3, meaning that current quantification capacity may be able to establish net carbon removal occurred, but for some approaches, very significant uncertainties remain.",

Larger particle sizes may reduce dissolution rates or result in material sinking to depth or buried in sediment, complicating the assessment of alkalinity released.",

This fractionation impacts  the total uptake of atmospheric CO\u2082. Overall CO\u2082 uptake efficiency can be estimated using seawater chemistry modeling software and the equation presented in [Renforth & Henderson (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1002/2016RG000533). These estimates could also be validated by measurements of bicarbonate concentrations or total alkalinity in the water column. The conversion of alkalinity to CO\u2082 removal is estimated to be 70-95% on a mol to mol basis.",

      "description": "Adding alkalinity to seawater shifts the pH and carbonate ion concentration, and could cause abiotic precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO\u2083) or brucite (Mg(OH)\u2082). This is important to characterize as this precipitation results in CO\u2082 outgassing. It remains to be determined what specific combination of suitable nucleation conditions and supersaturation of CaCO\u2083 is needed to cause significant precipitation. Abiotic precipitation can be minimized by controlling the particle dissolution rate as well as the dilution and dispersal of alkalinity-enhanced water. For some forms of mineral addition (e.g. addition fine Mg(OH)\u2082 particles), the addition, dilution and dispersal of alkalinity is easier to control than for others (e.g. dissolution of larger olivine particles), but there is [some](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2022.831587/full) [evidence](https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/bg-2022-126/) that localized effects of mineral dissolution may trigger significant secondary precipitation. Sampling total alkalinity near the dispersal point may help quantitatively determine the extent to which alkalinity is lost due to precipitation.",

Changes in biotic calcification rates could occur in both coastal and open ocean waters, and at the level of individual calcifiers or calcifier populations. In practice, quantifying the biotic calcification response to alkalinity addition may pose significant spatial, temporal, and signal-to-noise challenges.",

      "description": "Atmospheric uptake is reduced if alkalinity is transferred to the deep ocean before either increasing the uptake of atmospheric CO\u2082 or decreasing the outgassing of CO\u2082 to the atmosphere. The precise dispersal of alkalinity-enhanced water, its residence time at the surface, and hence the associated completeness of air-sea gas equilibration is dependent on the location and timing of the alkalinity additions, and is hard to directly observe. In-situ measurements can potentially track post-deployment changes in pCO\u2082, pH, and DIC and deploy water mass tracers to help validate models of plume dispersal and atmospheric CO\u2082 drawdown, though the sensitivity and cost of sensors may be a challenge. Further, oceanographic models can be used to develop probabilistic estimates of equilibration efficiencies for particular injection sites, contingent on seasonal or interannual variations in forcing regimes. Typical gas exchange timescales of equilibration for the surface ocean and atmosphere are on the order of months to years.",

      "description": "Additional formation of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) as a result of alkalinity addition could lead to more particulate organic carbon (POC) formation in the surface ocean. This effect could be quite small if plankton communities are primarily limited by nutrient availability, rather than DIC availability. However, it is possible for organisms to change their carbon-to-nutrient consumption ratios in response to changing environments, which could result in a shift toward increased carbon drawdown in the surface ocean. Because only a small fraction of this increased drawdown would result in permanent carbon storage in the deep ocean, we conservatively recommend this not be counted as additional sequestration or used to counterbalance project lifecycle emissions. POC export mediated by calcifying communities could also change in response to changes in biogenic calcification (see Biotic calcification response). Data on potential biological responses to removing CO\u2082 from the surface waters is still lacking.",
