  "pathway_name": "Ocean Biomass Sinking (No Harvest)",
  "pathway_description": "Ocean Biomass Sinking uses macroalgae to remove CO\u2082 from surface ocean, which in turn enhances the ability of the surface ocean to drawdown atmospheric CO\u2082. The biomass is sunk into the deep ocean to achieve long-term carbon storage. Here, we specifically consider approaches that do not harvest the biomass before sinking it. This pathway is VCL 1-2, meaning that current quantification capacity may be able to establish net carbon removal occurred, but that very significant uncertainties remain.",

      "description": "For systems that do not harvest kelp before sinking, kelp growth may be estimated with yield models that estimate biomass carbon as a function of species and strain, macro- and micronutrient availability, episodic mortality events like disease & storms, and other environmental factors that affect kelp growth. These models must be calibrated based on observational data, which could be derived from direct sampling and weighing, or from indirect measures from conjoined observational buoys (e.g. with instruments pointed at growing kelp). The mass of kelp grown can be converted to carbon using a default carbon content factor.",

This could be a result of biomass being shed during the sinking process, which could be modeled as a function of biomass type and sinking configuration based on field observations. For biomass that sinks after some period of floating in the open ocean (e.g. biomass-based buoys), the possibility that biomass may end up being beached or sinking in areas that do not result in permanent storage (e.g. shallow waters or areas of upwelling) must also be considered. Existing surface ocean transport models could be validated based on GPS-based observational data.",

This is an important factor to consider both in relation to broader ecosystem impacts and for quantifying carbon management outcomes. While only a fraction of the carbon removed by biological activity in the surface ocean will result in permanent carbon storage, we recommend a conservative stance of counting any decrease in surface ocean productivity against estimates of carbon removal achieved.",
